### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
	â€¢ validate input before processing 
 check that its the right type/format
	â€¢ a clear and uncluttered mainline  
 keep code to outside files that import and refer to eachother through mainline
	â€¢ one logical task per subroutine  
 in the name
	â€¢ use of stubs  
 use as substitute for undeveloped or in progress code
	â€¢ appropriate use of control structures and data structures  
 how you control or order data and code
	â€¢ writing for subsequent maintenance 
 make it easy to understand and edit
	â€¢ version control  
 have multiple instances of the same code, each in different stages of development
	â€¢ regular backup  
 helps prevent corruption or loss of work because of corruption
	â€¢ exception handling 
 how it handles errors or inputs that dont work
	â€¢ functions are able to return a single data structure or value 
they can return multiple pieces of data (in python, other languages may vary),
